## Biography ✍

#### Hello! My name is Arístides José Molina and I am a full-stack software engineer specializing in the use of JavaScript, React, Redux, and Rails to create software solutions for all types of companies worldwide.

#### I am currently completing courses at Microverse, a great remote software development experience that allows developers worldwide to program and build projects together. I have spent the last few months completely immersed and fully in remote development, building all kinds of applications, from landing pages to Rails APIs.

#### Before starting this exciting adventure at Microverse, I worked in the Software development department of a telecommunications company. While there I developed a monetary asset management application for Banco de Venezuela, one of the most important banks in that country. During the development of that system and others, I learned the skills that I now use every day as a developer: problem-solving, effective communication, multitasking, and more. I regularly won awards for software developers within the company and now I bring the same kind of energy to all my work, including my growth as a software engineer.

#### I've spent the last few months working remotely and asynchronously with people in seven different time zones, so when I read your post on LinkedIn looking for experienced remote developers, I immediately saw myself in the job description.

- Front-End: JavaScript, React, Redux, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3.
- Back-End: Ruby, Rails, MySQL.
- Tools & Methods: Git, GitHub, Heroku, Netlify, Mobile Development, RSpec, TDD, Chrome Dev Tools.
- Professional: Remote Pair-Programming, Teamwork, Mentoring.

#### I would love to schedule a 15-minute Zoom call to discuss the importance of remote software development and how it represents a competitive advantage for companies. Would you have some time next week?
