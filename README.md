## Biography ✍

#### Hi there! My name is Arístides José Molina and I am a full-stack software engineer specialized in JavaScript, React, Redux, and Rails creating solutions such as the telephone banking application that I developed with Asterisk for the bank of Venezuela, the most important bank from that country.

#### I am completing courses on Microverse, a remote software development experience with developers from all over the world. I have built all kinds of applications, such as landing pages to Rails API.

#### Before Microverse, I worked in the Software development department of many companies. Working, I learned problem-solving, effective communication, multitasking, and more. In those jobs, I won awards as a software developer for my performance.

#### I've worked remotely and asynchronously with people in seven different time zones, so when I read your post on LinkedIn looking for experienced remote developers, I immediately saw myself in the job description.

#### I would love to schedule a 15-minute Zoom call to discuss the importance of remote software development. Would you have some time next week?
